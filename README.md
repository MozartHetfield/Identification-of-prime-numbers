                                            [RO]Identification of prime numbers

 A project from algorithm analysis based on algorithms that identify prime numbers, Miller-Rabin and Fermat tests. I realized an
 exhaustive explanation, starting from history of the subject, explaining methods and mathematical relevant problems or flaws (Carmichael
 numbers, Fermat liars etc), to calculating the complexity and showing the results through tests implemented in Java.
